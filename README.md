#Project overview:
Contains five conveyor belts to move product, activating in reverse order (e.g., 5,4,3,2,1). Product begins on conveyor 1,
but successive conveyors must already be activated, so product does not enter onto a stopped conveyor belt. Conveyor belts
deactivate in forward order (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5).
